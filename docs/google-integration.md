import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

click on the "**Continue with Google**" button to take you through to Googleâ€™s authentication flow and get the necessary permissions.

Choose your Google account to continue with the authentication. Google will share your name, email address, language preference and profile picture with Plausible Analytics. We've set it so we get the absolutely minimum amount of information possible that Google allows us.

We really only need and use the email address from this. The email address is useful because some Plausible Analytics users have multiple Google accounts so we can remember which one is integrated with the Plausible Analytics site.

You also need to grant Plausible Analytics a permission to view your Search Console and Google Analytics data. Note that we will only access data for either if these if you enable the feature in your settings.

And you also need to confirm all these choices once again.
