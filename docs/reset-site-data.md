import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Within the "**Danger zone**" section of [your website settings](website-settings.md) you can reset your website stats. This removes all the stats you've collected until that point, including any imported data. Click on the "**Reset**" button to reset your stats from Plausible Analytics.
