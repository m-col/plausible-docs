If you are moving to Plausible from Google Analytics, you can display historic data collected with Google Analytics alongside your Plausible data in the main graph. This will show the number of visitors to your website from dates before when you stared using Plausible.

## Allow Plausible Analytics to access your Google Analytics data

Open the settings for your website on [your Plausible Analytics account](https://plausible.io/sites) and go into the settings section called "**Google Integration**":

If you haven't already, connect your Google account to your Plausible website following the steps outlined on the [Google Integration](google-integration.md) page.

Next, simply click the slider to enable the feature. This requires that your website's domain in Plausible matches that in Google Analytics.
